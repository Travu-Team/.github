Welcome to Travu – a smart platform from the Capstone Project @Coding Camp 2025 Powered by DBS Foundation. We believe technology can make exploring Indonesia a more **personal, informative, and socially impactful** experience 🌱🌏

## 🇮🇩 Background

Indonesia aims to be among the **top 10 global tourist destinations by 2045**! Tourist visits are steadily increasing (over 10 million by Sep 2024; 14.5 million in 2023), contributing 5.5% to the national GDP. However, this growth brings challenges: **balancing tourism with environmental and cultural protection**.

As avid explorers, we noticed a lack of platforms recommending destinations based on personal interests. Indonesia boasts incredible natural beauty and amazing tourist spots that deserve to be fully explored.
