Welcome to Travu – a smart platform developed as part of our Capstone Project for Coding Camp 2025, Powered by DBS Foundation.

We're an inter-campus team that believes technology can make exploring Indonesia a more **personal, informative, and socially impactful** experience 🌱🌏

## 🇮🇩 Background

Indonesia aims to be among the **top 10 global tourist destinations by 2045**! This vision is supported by consistently increasing tourist visits, reaching over 10 million by September 2024 (a 20.28% increase from the previous year), and recording 14.5 million tourists in 2023. The tourism sector is also a vital economic pillar, contributing **5.5% to the national GDP**.

However, amid this rapid growth, Indonesia faces a significant challenge: **balancing tourism development with environmental and cultural protection**. While increased tourist numbers bring substantial economic benefits, they risk negatively impacting destination sustainability if not managed wisely.

As avid explorers and travelers across Indonesia, including in my current home region, I often wondered: why isn't there a platform that can recommend destinations based on our personal interests and preferences? I believe many others share the same passion for discovering new places, especially given Indonesia's abundant natural beauty and amazing tourist attractions.

## 💡 Our Solution

Travu offers a solution. With **AI** and **machine learning**, we provide **personalized travel recommendations** that are **eco-friendly and respect local culture**. Travu aligns with Indonesia's vision for sustainable tourism, creating balanced growth while preserving natural and cultural richness for future generations.

We've built **Travu (Travel With You)**, a tourism recommendation platform powered by **Artificial Intelligence** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, using a **hybrid approach** to deliver optimal recommendations.

### Key Travu Features:
* ✅ **Hybrid AI-Powered Destination Recommendation System**:
    * Provides **highly relevant** destination recommendations tailored to user preferences through **Content-Based Filtering** (using TF-IDF Cosine Similarity), effective even for new users.
    * Enhances accuracy and captures complex preference patterns with a **Neural Network Model** (Multi-Layer Perceptron) that predicts relevance.
    * Combines both approaches with **strategic weighting** (0.7 for direct content similarity, 0.3 for Neural Network prediction) for a comprehensive `final_score`.
* ✅ **Intuitive Itinerary Planning Feature**: Makes it easier for users to plan their trips in a structured way.

With Travu, exploring tourist destinations becomes **smarter, more focused, and more meaningful**. ✨
